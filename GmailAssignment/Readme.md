# Gmail Assignment

Recreate the grid structure of gmail like this image: https://cdn.fs.teachablecdn.com/LmkAqzsRSAS2hCGPYJnD </br>
Then make the columns responsive to screen size changes.
My attempt: https://lw6xp3.csb.app/ (forgot to fork the layout, so this is infact the "advanced layout". Previous attempt was just the coloured background. responsive/dynamic scaling using media screen was also in the original design.)
